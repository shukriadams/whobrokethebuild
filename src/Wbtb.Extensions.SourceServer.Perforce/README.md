Perforce integration in WBTB is stateless - you don't have to set any environment variables or P4 session for the WBTB host environment.

`TrustFingerprint` is required for SSL servers only, is the fingerprint of your SSL Key, and looks like `xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx`. You can obtain it by running `p4 trust -l` against your Perforce server. See
